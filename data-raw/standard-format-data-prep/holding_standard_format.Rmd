Data were checked and cleaned in scripts available [here](https://github.com/FlowWest/JPE-datasets/tree/main/data-raw/qc-markdowns/adult-holding-redd-and-carcass-surveys).
Cleaned data were saved on the jpe-dev-bucket on google cloud.

## Battle Creek

```{r, battle_holding_data_dictionary}
battle_data_dictionary <- read_rds("data-raw/qc-markdowns/adult-holding-redd-and-carcass-surveys/data-dictionaries/battle_holding_data_dictionary.rds")
kable(battle_data_dictionary)

# field for crew name etc to indicate that there are duplicates

         year = lubridate::year(date),
         adipose_clipped = "not recorded",
         run = "spring") # either spring or unknown, but not recorded in raw data
  

```

### Varibles removed

- notes: internal use

## Clear Creek

```{r, clear_holding_data_dictionary}
clear_data_dictionary <- read_rds("data-raw/qc-markdowns/adult-holding-redd-and-carcass-surveys/data-dictionaries/clear_holding_data_dictionary.rds")
kable(clear_data_dictionary)
```
```{r, clear_clean}
# There are multiple observations per reach. Checked raw data and there is not a 
# field for crew name etc to indicate that there are duplicates
clear_holding_clean <- clear_holding %>%
  select(-comments) %>%
  rename(jacks = jack_count) %>%
  mutate(stream = "clear creek",
         year = lubridate::year(date),
         run = "spring",
         adipose_clipped = "not recorded")
```

### Variables removed

- comments: internal use


## Deer Creek

```{r, deer_holding_data_dictionary}
deer_data_dictionary <- read_rds("data-raw/qc-markdowns/adult-holding-redd-and-carcass-surveys/data-dictionaries/deer_holding_data_dictionary.rds")
kable(deer_data_dictionary)
```

```{r, deer_clean}
deer_holding_clean <- bind_rows(deer_holding_1986_1996,
                                deer_holding_1997_2020) %>%
  rename(reach = location) %>%
  mutate(stream = "deer creek",
         date = as_date(paste0(year, "-08-01")),
         run = "spring",
         adipose_clipped = as.character(F)) # no hatchery, any adipose clipped fish would be strays
```

### Variables removed

- none

## Butte Creek

Note that this is annual data at the Butte Creek level rather than daily at the reach level.

Date is assigned as August 1 of the year to make it easier to use with other datasets

```{r, butte_clean}
butte_holding_clean <- butte_holding |> 
  mutate(stream = "butte creek",
         run = "spring",
         adipose_clipped = "not recorded",
         date = as_date(paste0(year, "-08-01"))) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

### Variables removed
- comments, personnel removed
- Butte creek data has multiple observations from different personnels per day - to prevent double counting, the average of each day at each reach is used as the daily fish count

# Standard format {.tabset}
```{r, combined}
combined_holding <- bind_rows(battle_holding_clean,
                              butte_holding_clean,
                              clear_holding_clean,
                              deer_holding_clean)
```

## Save file without standardized reaches
We need all raw reaches to pull into `analysis/adult-reach-analysis.R`

# Save data
```{r, save_data}
f <- function(input, output) write_csv(input, file = output)

gcs_upload(combined_holding,
           object_function = f,
           type = "csv",
           name = "standard-format-data/standard_holding_raw_reaches.csv",
           predefinedAcl = "bucketLevel")
```
## Survey Reach Standardization

Survey reach naming conventions changed over time for several monitoring programs. A standardized reach lookup table was created in `analysis/adult-reach-analysis.R` and is merged in here to standardize all reaches.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gcs_get_object(
  object_name = "jpe-model-data/standard_reach_lookup.csv",
  bucket = gcs_get_global_bucket(),
  saveToDisk = here::here("data", "standard-format-data", "standard-reach-lookup.csv"),
  overwrite = TRUE
)

standard_reach_lookup <- read_csv(here::here("data", "standard-format-data", "standard-reach-lookup.csv")) |> 
  # join sub-reach for butte
  mutate(standardized_reach = ifelse(stream == "butte creek", standardized_sub_reach, standardized_reach),
         reach = ifelse(stream == "butte creek", sub_reach, reach)) |>
  select(stream, reach, standardized_reach)

combined_holding <- combined_holding |> 
  left_join(standard_reach_lookup, by = c("stream", "reach")) |>
  select(-reach) |> 
  rename(reach = standardized_reach) |> 
  relocate(reach, .before = river_mile) |> 
  glimpse()
```

## Exploratory plots

Total count per year for each waterbody

```{r}
combined_holding %>% 
  group_by(year, stream) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, fill = stream))+
  geom_col()
```

Average count per month. This chart shows Battle, Butte and Clear; Deer does not have monthly count.

```{r}
combined_holding %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(date)) %>% 
  group_by(month, stream) %>% 
  summarize(average_count = mean(count, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = average_count, fill = stream)) +
  geom_col()
```

Average jacks per month. Jacks is only collected at Battle and Clear.
```{r}
combined_holding %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(date)) %>% 
  group_by(month, stream) %>% 
  summarize(average_jacks = mean(jacks, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = average_jacks, fill = stream)) + 
  geom_col()
```

River mile distribution for Battle and Clear

```{r}
combined_holding %>% 
  filter(!is.na(river_mile)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = stream, y = river_mile)) + 
  geom_boxplot(
  )
```

# QA/QC {.tabset}

# Categorical Variables

```{r, categorical_variables}
unique(combined_holding$reach)
unique(combined_holding$stream)
unique(combined_holding$survey_intent)
unique(combined_holding$picket_weir_relate)
```

# Count

Monthly count is not recorded for Deer.

Figure below shows the percentage count by month for each waterbody except Deer and Butte.
```{r, count_qaqc}

total_count <- combined_holding %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% 
  group_by(stream) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(count, na.rm = T))

combined_holding %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% 
  group_by(stream, month) %>% 
  summarize(count = sum(count, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  left_join(total_count) %>% 
  mutate(percent = (count/total)*100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= month, y = percent, fill = stream)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~stream, scales = "free_y")
```

*  `r round(sum(is.na(combined_holding$count))/nrow(combined_holding), 3)*100` % of values in the `count` column are NA.

## Jacks
Jacks are not recorded for Deer and Butte

Figure below show the percentage count by month for Battle and Clear.

```{r, jack_qa_qc}
total_jacks <- combined_holding %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% 
  group_by(stream) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(jacks, na.rm = T))

combined_holding %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% 
  group_by(stream, month) %>% 
  summarize(count = sum(jacks, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  left_join(total_jacks) %>% 
  mutate(percent = (count/total)*100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= month, y = percent, fill = stream)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~stream, scales = "free_y")
```

*  `r round(sum(is.na(combined_holding$jacks))/nrow(combined_holding), 3)*100` % of values in the `jacks` column are NA.

# Save data
```{r, save_data}
f <- function(input, output) write_csv(input, file = output)

gcs_upload(combined_holding,
           object_function = f,
